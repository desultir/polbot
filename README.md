IRC over Gtalk

Create a #irc-like chatroom on GTalk. Allows your friends to #join, #topic, #nick, /me... all the big commands.

REQUIREMENTS:
You need to set up a new gmail account and friend all the people who you want to give access to the server. Drop
the user/password into the PyGtalkRobot.py in place of ##PASSWORD## and you're away.

Depends on https://code.google.com/p/pygtalkrobot/ PyGtalkRobot.

As I have fixed several bugs in PyGtalkRobot's code, I've had to rehost my modified version here. Yes, I've tried 
to upstream the changes; the project appears to be dead :(
